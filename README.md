## üöÄ Technologies Used

### Backend Architecture: Microservices
Solvex is designed with a microservice architecture for better scalability, maintainability, and independent development cycles.

*   **Auth Service (Login Service):** Responsible for user registration, login, authorization, email verification, and password management.
    *   **Technologies:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, Lombok.
*   **Question Service:** Responsible for creating, updating, deleting, listing questions, and managing the question pool.
    *   **Technologies:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, Lombok.
*   **Quiz Service:** Responsible for exam creation, publishing, (indirectly) student assignments, receiving submissions, scoring, and results analysis. Communicates with other services via APIs.
    *   **Technologies:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, RestTemplate, Lombok.

### Frontend
*   **React (JavaScript):** For developing a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
*   **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to backend services.
*   **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structure and styling.
*   **FontAwesome:** For icons.
*   **Chart.js:** For displaying charts in exam results analysis.

### Database
*   **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for all services.

### Other Tools
*   **Apache Maven:** Project dependency management and build.
*   **Git & GitHub:** Version control system.
*   **IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code:** Development environment.
*   **Postman:** For API testing.
*   **Apache JMeter:** For performance testing.
*   **(If used) Service Discovery (e.g., Eureka):** For services to find each other.
*   **(If used) API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway):** For routing client requests.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 
*   Apache Maven
*   PostgreSQL Database Server
*   Node.js and npm (for Frontend)
*   Git

### Backend Services Setup
The following steps should be applied for each backend service (Auth, Question, Quiz):

1.  **Clone the Project (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solvex-project.git
    cd solvex-project/auth-service # (or question-service, quiz-service)
    ```

2.  **Database Configuration:**
    *   Create a separate database in PostgreSQL for each service (e.g., `auth_db`, `question_db`, `quiz_db`).
    *   Update the database connection details (`spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, `spring.datasource.password`) in each service's `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `.yml`) file according to your PostgreSQL setup.
    *   Ensure `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` is set to `update` or `create` (for initial setup).

3.  **Install Dependencies and Build:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the Service:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    # Or build the JAR and run it:
    # mvn package
    # java -jar target/auth-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (Check the filename)
    ```
    *Note: For services to communicate (especially Quiz Service with others), if you are not using service discovery (like Eureka), you might need to configure the addresses of other services correctly in their `application.properties` files (e.g., `http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER`).*

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend-react-directory # Your frontend project's directory
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Addresses:**
    Ensure the backend service addresses are correctly configured in your frontend code (usually in `services/authService.js` or an `apiConfig.js` file, e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/v1` for Auth Service).

4.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will typically open at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints (Examples)

*(You can add a few key endpoints from your Postman or Swagger documentation here as examples, or provide a link to your Swagger UI.)*

**Auth Service:**
*   `POST /api/v1/registration` - New user registration
*   `POST /api/v1/login` - User login
*   `POST /api/v1/users/summaries` - Get user summaries by list of IDs

**Question Service:**
*   `GET /question/allQuestions` - List all questions
*   `POST /question/add` - Add a new question

**Quiz Service:**
*   `POST /quiz/save` - Create/publish a new exam
*   `GET /quiz/getQuestions/{quizId}` - Get questions for an exam
*   `POST /quiz/submit/{quizId}` - Submit exam answers

*(For more detailed API documentation, you can visit [Swagger UI Link] - if available.)*

## üöÄ Future Work and Enhancements

*   [+] Add more question types (e.g., Matching, Drag & Drop).
*   [ ] Implement advanced exam security features (e.g., proctoring integration, plagiarism detection).
*   [ ] Allow bulk question import for instructors (Excel/CSV format).
*   [ ] Provide more detailed performance feedback and progress tracking for students.
*   [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness and potentially develop a mobile application.
*   [ ] Integrate message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous inter-service communication.
*   [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
